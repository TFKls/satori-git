Repository Layout
-----------------

Each project component has its own directory under the repository root.
Components should be self-contained (as far as feasible), with global
build machinery putting everything together.

As a general rule, the repository should _not_ contain any files which can
be automatically generated. Instead, a suitable script should be included.


Dependencies
------------

Project dependencies (together with the build process) should be handled
by setuptools configuration. External packages should _not_ be placed within
the repository, unless their _modified_ version is required (even then,
a patching script might be more suitable).


Build Environment
-----------------

The following programs are required to work with the project:
 * python >=2.6
 * mercurial >=1.5
 * subversion >=1.6
 * setuptools >=0.6
 * virtualenv >=1.4

To prepare the work environment (after hg clone), run (from the repository
root):

 ./develop.sh
