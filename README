Repository Layout
-----------------

The mercurial repository is layed out as follows:

(repository root)
 |
 + external            #  all out-of-project content, organized by source; 
 |   + ...             #  includes (complete) external (sub-)repositories
 |
 + libs                #  library files used by project,
 |   + java            #  organized by programming language;
 |   + python          #  may contain sources of libs developed within the project
 |   + ...             #  or symlinks to (source of compiled) files in ../external
 |
 + satori              #  the project source files, organized by component
 |   + core            #
 |   + judge           #
 |   + ui              #
 |   + ...             #
 |
 + scripts             #  build and test scripts (including configuration),
     + ...             #  possibly other _machine-independent_ content
 
As a general rule, the repository should _not_ contain any files which can
be automatically generated. Instead, a suitable script should be included.


Dependencies
------------

Most project dependencies (_all_ run-time dependencies and those _from_ which the
project is built) should be placed within the repository (usually under external/).
Dependencies required _to_ build the system belong to the environment (described
below), unless they are very exotic.


Build Environment
-----------------

The following programs are required to work with the project:
 * python >=2.6
 * pylint >=0.19
 * mercurial >=1.5
 * subversion >=1.6

The build scripts (may) require the following variables to be set (${repo} is the
repository root):
 * PYTHONPATH=${repo}:${repo}/libs/python
