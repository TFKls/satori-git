# BOOT_DEGRADED:
# Do you want to boot your system if a RAID providing your root filesystem
# becomes degraded?
#
# Running a system with a degraded RAID could result in permanent data loss
# if it suffers another hardware fault.
#
# However, you might answer "yes" if this system is a server, expected to
# tolerate hardware faults and boot unattended.
